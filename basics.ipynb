      "7. **Model Evaluation**: After training, we evaluate the model on the test set and print the mean absolute error.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Application: Medical Image Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Problem:\n",
      "Radiologists often need to analyze medical images to detect abnormalities such as tumors, fractures, or other signs of disease. This process can be time-consuming and is subject to human error.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Solution:\n",
      "Neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be trained to automatically analyze medical images and identify patterns associated with specific conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### How It Works:\n",
      "1. **Data Collection**: A large dataset of labeled medical images is collected. Each image is labeled with the presence or absence of specific conditions (e.g., tumor, no tumor).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Preprocessing**: The images are preprocessed to ensure consistency in size, resolution, and format. This step may also include normalization and augmentation to improve the model's robustness.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Model Training**: A CNN is designed and trained on the dataset. During training, the network learns to identify features and patterns in the images that correlate with the labels. The network adjusts the weights of its connections to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Validation and Testing**: The trained model is validated and tested on separate datasets to evaluate its accuracy and generalization ability. This step ensures that the model performs well on unseen data.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Deployment**: Once validated, the model can be deployed in clinical settings to assist radiologists. It can quickly analyze new images and highlight areas of concern, providing a second opinion and reducing the workload on medical professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Benefits:\n",
      "- **Increased Efficiency**: Neural networks can process large volumes of images much faster than humans.\n",
      "- **Improved Accuracy**: They can detect subtle patterns that might be missed by the human eye, potentially leading to earlier and more accurate diagnoses.\n",
      "- **Scalability**: Once trained, the model can be easily scaled to analyze images from different hospitals or regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This application of neural networks not only enhances the capabilities of healthcare professionals but also contributes to better patient outcomes by facilitating early and accurate disease detection.\n"

    "You are a systems engineer tasked with analyzing text to identify variables and their causal relationships for constructing a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD). Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Primary Variables**  \n",
    "   - First, read through the original input text carefully.  \n",
    "   - Extract all key entities or components (e.g., “salesmen,” “orders,” “product delivery,” “revenue,” etc.).  \n",
    "   - If certain variables overlap or share commonalities, group them thematically (e.g., “sales workforce,” “budget,” “capacity,” etc.).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Break Down Sub-Factors**  \n",
    "   - Within each primary variable, look for nuanced factors that might influence or be influenced by others (e.g., “delivery delay,” “acquisition delay,” “order backlog”).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Map Causal Relationships**  \n",
    "   - For each pair of related variables, specify the relationship in the following format:  \n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "       [Variable A] --> ([+/-]) [Variable B]\n",
    "     \\]  \n",
    "     Use **(+)** if an increase in Variable A leads to an increase in Variable B. Use **(-)** if an increase in Variable A leads to a decrease in Variable B.  \n",
    "   - Provide your **Reasoning** next: Explain how you determined the relationship. If something in the original text supports or illustrates this cause-effect linkage, reference it.  \n",
    "   - Under **Relevant Text**, include the **exact sentence(s) or phrase(s)** from the original input text that justifies your relationship. Enclose these quotes clearly (e.g., in quotation marks).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add Feedback Loops**  \n",
    "   - Identify any cyclical cause-effect paths (e.g., “salesmen → revenue → budget → more salesmen”).  \n",
    "   - Label loops as either *Reinforcing (R)* or *Balancing (B)*, depending on whether they amplify or stabilize the system.  \n",
    "   - Include a short note on how the loop works overall, mentioning how the sign of relationships causes growth (reinforcing) or equilibrium (balancing).  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Account for Delays**  \n",
    "   - If the text mentions time delays in processes (e.g., “acquisition delay,” “delivery delay”), highlight them.  \n",
    "   - Explain how delays might shift or weaken the speed of the feedback loop’s response.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Suggest Interventions**  \n",
    "   - Based on the relationships identified, propose one or more policy or managerial interventions that could alter the system’s outcome (e.g., “shorten acquisition delay,” “increase capacity earlier”).  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Visualize: Generate a Causal Loop Diagram**  \n",
    "   - Finally, draw a rough CLD or outline how the variables connect in a diagram, showing loops, signs (+/-), and any delays.  \n",

      "#### **Step 1: Identify Primary Variables**\n",
      "From the text, the following primary variables are identified:\n",
      "1. **Prostate Volume**  \n",
      "2. **PSA Level**  \n",
      "3. **Lesion Characteristics**  \n",
      "   - Lesion 1: Left peripheral zone, mid gland (PI-RADS 5)  \n",

      "#### **Step 2: Break Down Sub-Factors**\n",
      "Each primary variable has sub-factors that influence or are influenced by others:\n",
      "- **Prostate Volume**: May correlate with PSA levels and lesion development.  \n",
      "- **PSA Level**: Elevated PSA levels are often associated with prostate abnormalities, including cancer.  \n",
      "- **Lesion Characteristics**: Include location, diffusion restriction, ADC value, and enhancement patterns.  \n",
      "- **PI-RADS Score**: A higher score (e.g., 5) indicates a higher likelihood of clinically significant prostate cancer.  \n",
      "- **Cancer Risk**: Determined by lesion characteristics, PI-RADS score, and PSA levels.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 3: Map Causal Relationships**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prostate Volume --> (+) PSA Level**  \n",
      "   **Reasoning:** Larger prostate volume can lead to increased PSA levels due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or other conditions.  \n",
      "   **Relevant Text:** \"Prostate Volume: 45 cc\" and \"PSA Level: 5.8 ng/mL.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Lesion Characteristics (e.g., restricted diffusion, enhancement) --> (+) PI-RADS Score**  \n",
      "   **Reasoning:** Lesions with significant restricted diffusion and early enhancement (e.g., Lesion 1) are assigned higher PI-RADS scores, indicating a higher likelihood of clinically significant cancer.  \n",
      "   **Relevant Text:** \"Lesion 1... shows significant restricted diffusion... focal early enhancement... PI-RADS Score: 5.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **PI-RADS Score --> (+) Cancer Risk**  \n",
      "   **Reasoning:** Higher PI-RADS scores (e.g., 5) are strongly associated with a higher risk of clinically significant prostate cancer.  \n",
      "   **Relevant Text:** \"PI-RADS Score: 5\" for Lesion 1 indicates a high likelihood of clinically significant cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **PSA Level --> (+) Cancer Risk**  \n",
      "   **Reasoning:** Elevated PSA levels are a biomarker for prostate cancer risk, although they can also be elevated due to benign conditions.  \n",
      "   **Relevant Text:** \"PSA Level: 5.8 ng/mL.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Prostate Volume --> (+) Lesion Development**  \n",
      "   **Reasoning:** Larger prostate volume may increase the likelihood of lesion development due to increased tissue mass and potential for abnormalities.  \n",
      "   **Relevant Text:** \"Prostate Volume: 45 cc.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Cancer Risk --> (+) Need for Biopsy/Intervention**  \n",
      "   **Reasoning:** Higher cancer risk, as indicated by PI-RADS scores and PSA levels, increases the likelihood of recommending a biopsy or other diagnostic interventions.  \n",
      "   **Relevant Text:** Not explicitly stated but implied by clinical practice guidelines for prostate cancer diagnosis.\n",

      "#### **Step 5: Account for Delays**\n",
      "- **Diagnostic Delay:** There may be a delay between identifying elevated PSA levels or suspicious lesions and performing a biopsy or other diagnostic interventions.  \n",
      "- **Progression Delay:** Lesions may progress over time, increasing PI-RADS scores and cancer risk if not promptly addressed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 6: Suggest Interventions**\n",
      "1. **Early Biopsy for High PI-RADS Scores:** Lesion 1 (PI-RADS 5) should be prioritized for biopsy to confirm or rule out clinically significant cancer.  \n",
      "2. **Monitor PSA Levels and Lesion Progression:** Regular follow-up for Lesions 2 and 3 (PI-RADS 3) to detect any changes in characteristics or PSA levels.  \n",

      "### Explanation of the CLD\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reinforcing Loop R1 (Diagnostic Escalation):**\n",
      "   - Elevated PSA levels lead to a higher likelihood of prostate cancer investigation (e.g., MRI).\n",
      "   - MRI detects lesion characteristics, which influence the PI-RADS score.\n",
      "   - Higher PI-RADS scores increase the likelihood of clinically significant prostate cancer, which reinforces the need for PSA monitoring and further diagnostic escalation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Balancing Loop B1 (Prostate Volume and PSA Specificity):**\n",
      "   - Larger prostate volumes increase PSA levels, but this reduces the accuracy of PSA as a cancer indicator.\n",
      "   - Reduced accuracy limits unnecessary investigations, balancing the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Delays (Not explicitly shown in the CLD but important to consider):\n",
      "1. **Delay in Lesion Detection:** Time lag between elevated PSA levels and MRI scheduling.\n",
      "2. **Delay in Cancer Progression:** Lag between lesion detection and further PSA elevation or symptom manifestation.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggested Interventions (Impact on CLD):\n",
      "1. **Improve PSA Specificity:** Weakens the balancing loop (B1) by improving PSA accuracy, leading to more targeted investigations.\n",
      "2. **Streamline MRI Scheduling:** Reduces delays in the reinforcing loop (R1), accelerating the diagnostic process.\n",
      "3. **Risk Stratification Based on PI-RADS Scores:** Optimizes resource allocation by focusing on high-risk patients.\n",
      "4. **Monitor Prostate Volume Trends:** Adjusts PSA thresholds based on prostate size, improving diagnostic accuracy.\n",
