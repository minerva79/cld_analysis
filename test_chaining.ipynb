      "\n",
      "1. **Prostate Volume --> (+) PSA Level**  \n",

      "   **Relevant Text:** \"MRI Technique: Multi-parametric MRI with T2-weighted images, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI.\"\n",

      "Based on the causal relationships identified, here are the feedback loops present in the system:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Feedback Loops  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Loop R1 (Reinforcing): PSA Level and Cancer Suspicion**  \n",
      "   **Path:** Prostate Volume → (+) PSA Level → (+) PI-RADS Score → (+) Cancer Suspicion  \n",
      "   **Explanation:** As prostate volume increases, PSA levels rise, which can lead to higher PI-RADS scores and increased suspicion of clinically significant cancer. This loop reinforces the diagnostic focus on patients with larger prostates and higher PSA levels.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Loop R2 (Reinforcing): MRI Technique and Lesion Detection**  \n",
      "   **Path:** MRI Technique → (+) Lesion Detection → (+) Lesion Characteristics → (+) PI-RADS Score → (+) Cancer Suspicion  \n",
      "   **Explanation:** The use of advanced MRI techniques improves lesion detection and characterization, leading to higher PI-RADS scores and increased cancer suspicion. This loop reinforces the importance of high-quality imaging in identifying clinically significant lesions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Loop B1 (Balancing): Lesion Location and Cancer Suspicion**  \n",
      "   **Path:** Lesion Location → (+) Lesion Characteristics → (+) PI-RADS Score → (+) Cancer Suspicion → (-) Lesion Location (targeted biopsy or treatment)  \n",
      "   **Explanation:** As lesions with high PI-RADS scores are identified and targeted for biopsy or treatment, the number of suspicious lesions in specific locations decreases, balancing the system by reducing cancer suspicion over time.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Account for Delays  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **PSA Level and Cancer Suspicion Delay:**  \n",
      "   - There may be a delay between an increase in PSA levels and the identification of suspicious lesions through imaging or biopsy. This delay can slow the diagnostic process and potentially impact early detection.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **MRI Technique and Lesion Detection Delay:**  \n",
      "   - The time required to perform and interpret multi-parametric MRI scans introduces a delay in lesion detection and characterization. This delay can affect the speed of diagnosis and subsequent treatment planning.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biopsy or Treatment Delay:**  \n",
      "   - After lesions are identified and cancer suspicion is raised, there may be a delay in performing biopsies or initiating treatment, which can impact patient outcomes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 6: Suggestions  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Optimize PSA Screening Protocols:**  \n",
      "   - Implement more frequent or targeted PSA screenings for patients with larger prostate volumes to identify potential abnormalities earlier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Enhance MRI Accessibility and Efficiency:**  \n",
      "   - Invest in faster and more accessible MRI technology to reduce delays in lesion detection and characterization.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Prioritize High PI-RADS Lesions:**  \n",
      "   - Focus diagnostic and treatment efforts on lesions with higher PI-RADS scores (e.g., PI-RADS 5) to address the most clinically significant cases promptly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Streamline Biopsy and Treatment Processes:**  \n",
      "   - Reduce delays in biopsy scheduling and treatment initiation by improving coordination between radiologists, urologists, and oncologists.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Develop Predictive Models:**  \n",
      "   - Use machine learning models to predict cancer risk based on PSA levels, prostate volume, and lesion characteristics, enabling earlier and more accurate interventions.  \n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Nodes and Relationships**:  \n",
      "   - Each variable (e.g., \"Prostate Volume\", \"PSA Level\") is represented as a node.  \n",
      "   - Arrows between nodes represent causal relationships, labeled with the sign of the relationship (`+` or `-`).  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Feedback Loops**:  \n",
      "   - Feedback loops are labeled as `Loop R1`, `Loop R2`, and `Loop B1`.  \n",
      "   - Dotted arrows connect the loops to the relevant nodes to indicate their influence.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Reinforcing Loops**:  \n",
      "   - `Loop R1`: Prostate Volume → PSA Level → PI-RADS Score → Cancer Suspicion reinforces the diagnostic focus on patients with larger prostates and higher PSA levels.  \n",
      "   - `Loop R2`: MRI Technique → Lesion Detection → Lesion Characteristics → PI-RADS Score → Cancer Suspicion reinforces the importance of advanced imaging techniques.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Balancing Loop**:  \n",
      "   - `Loop B1`: Lesion Location → Lesion Characteristics → PI-RADS Score → Cancer Suspicion → Lesion Location balances the system by reducing cancer suspicion as lesions are targeted for biopsy or treatment.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Rendering the Diagram  \n",
      "\n",
      "To render the diagram:  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Save the script as a `.dot` file (e.g., `causal_loop_diagram.dot`).  \n",
      "2. Use Graphviz to generate the visualization:  \n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   dot -Tpng causal_loop_diagram.dot -o causal_loop_diagram.png\n",
      "   ```  \n",
      "3. Open the generated `causal_loop_diagram.png` file to view the diagram.  \n",
